<li>
<b>Keep it short</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Business plans should be short and concise. An extremely lengthy business plan is a hassle to
deal with, and guarantees that your plan will be demoted.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>


<li>
<b>Know your audience</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Business plans should be written in a language that your audience will understand. 

Accommodate your investors, and keep explanations of your product simple and direct, using 

terms that everyone can understand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>

<li>
<b>Dont be intimidated</b>
<br/>
<br/>
The majority of business owners and entrepreneurs arent business experts. If you know your

business and are passionate about it, writing a business plan and then leveraging your plan for 

growth will be easy.
